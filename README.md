dotfiles
========

Just some configuration.

My dotfiles:
The vimrc is a work in progress; made some mappings but the level of customization is somewhat minimal. (call it learning and mapping as I go along).

I also prefer to install vim plugins as I need them, which I believe works for me,  hence I have just a few plugins.


Inspiration:
Yeah, ive been studying the dotfiles and the configurations of others and i want to appreciate them for making them available:
