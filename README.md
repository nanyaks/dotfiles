dotfiles
========

Just some configuration.

My dotfiles; nothing special!
The tmux.conf is in a very confused state as is. I strongly feel you should not use this at the moment.
The vimrc is a work in progress. Not too many mappings yet and the level of customization is somewhat minimal. Just a few plugins ((and i dont plan on having more than just a few of them)).


Inspiration:
-   romainl
-   athaeryn
-   mattboehm
-   paradigm
-   jperras
-   rbates

-   Oh-my-zsh team for the wonderful customizations i have on my shell.
